This repository contains a set of testing codes of the Groovy parallel Patterns (GPP) library.

Contact J.Kerridge@napier.ac.uk

The codes are based on the JUnit tests contained in groovyParallelPatterns modified so that they can make use of the GPP_Builder program.

It also contains a set of scripts that allow the use of the code Visualisations that can also be built using GPP_Builder.

The script BuildAllTests converts all the *.gpp scripts into *.groovy files that can be run.

The script RunAllTests causes all the test codes that do not use the Visualiser to run.

Each Visualisation code needs to be run individually. so that interaction with the Visualisation can be observed and interacted with.
